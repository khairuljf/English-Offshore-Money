                                    <h2>Where can I open an Offshore Company?</h2>
                                    Nowadays we are opening offshore companies in Delaware, USA and companies in Belize. We recommend these locations because they are easy to open and they work in any country around the world.
                                    <h2>Do I have to pay taxes if I open an offshore company?</h2>
                                    The good news is that you donâ€™t have to pay taxes if you have one of these companies, unless you do business in a country which is not offshore, but I assure you that you will save a lot.
                                    <h2>Is there any yearly payment to maintain the enterprises?</h2>
                                    The good thing about enterprises in Delaware, USA is that you only pay $250.00 per year, and in Belize $600 per year. It all depends on the intended use and the countries where you desire to open your account. I recommend you to consult directly with these locations to find which option is best for you.
                                    <h2>May I open bank accounts later?</h2>
                                    You can start companies in any country that allows USA or Belize companies to work, we recommend you to open a bank account with us, after your company is started.
                                    <h2>Do businesses include TAX ID or fiscal numbers?</h2>
                                    Yes, companies in the USA come with a tax ID (fiscal number) so that you can open accounts later within the countries that require them.
                                    <h2>How long does it take to open the offshore company?</h2>
                                    The offshore company can take 3-5 business days to open. We send you online certificates, and then through Fedex or some other form of express mail.
                                    <h2>How can I start opening my new offshore company?</h2>
                                    Nowadays, anyone can open an offshore company, you just have to get in touch with us and we will open your offshore company automatically.
