              <p>Overview</p>
            <p>By accepting the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, you expressly consent to us collecting, using and disclosing your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Collection of Personal Information</p>
            <p>To open your Offshore Money®, we need to obtain certain personal information from you, such as your full name, address, email, phone number and your date of birth. For certain optional transactions, we also collect financial information such as credit or debit card details. For certain high value transactions, we may be required to report personal information to the relevant authorities. For verification purposes we reserve the right to request proof of your identity and proof of address. When using our services, your IP address and login times are recorded and stored for purposes of preventing fraud and enhancing the security of our services. We may also collect usage and access data that allows us to prevent multiple account openings or other fraudulent behavior or to protect our systems against illegal attacks or abuse. Strictly for this purpose, we may share such data with specialized and trustworthy fraud management services that help us analyze the data. We may also use cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Information collected and stored through cookies may be matched against the personal data we hold on our systems. When you send money to a user that is not yet registered with Offshore Money®, we will store that user's email address for at least fourteen days during which time the user can collect the funds. If the user does not register for Offshore Money®Account, the user's email address will no longer be used by Offshore Money®, however it will remain to be stored as part of your transaction history. You must ensure that you have obtained all necessary consents for the use of the recipient's email address. Depending on the information you have provided us, your current verification status and the type of transaction you wish to undertake, we may collect further information from banks, credit/debit card processing services, identity verification services and credit reference agencies. See the section on &quot;Use of Personal Information&quot; for further details.</p>
            <p>Use of Personal Information</p>
            <p>We use your personal information to operate your Offshore Money® Account and to provide our services. We also share certain information as with banks or credit/debit card processing services, identity verification services and credit reference agencies as part of our normal business operations. The purpose for sharing this data is to identify and verify users and to limit our exposure fraud and other criminal activities and to manage our financial risk. When conducting identification or fraud prevention checks, the service provider may retain a record of our query along with your information. By using our services you expressly agree to the sharing of your personal date for these purposes. Furthermore, when sending money to another Offshore Money® Account holder we will, at a minimum, pass on your email address to the recipient. .We may also send other personal details such as your name, address and country of residence to recipients of any payments you make if such recipients request this information from us in order to improve the payment process, to reconcile payments with the commercial transaction or to conduct their own anti-fraud and anti-money laundering checks. We may also share your personal data with other companies within the Offshore Money® corporate group that are involved in providing services to you or the recipient of a payment. You personal data may be shared with entities outside the European Economic Area (&quot;EEA&quot;) if this is necessary for providing you with the services requested by you, for example if you transfer funds to a merchant that is not located in the EEA. You expressly consent to the sharing of your data in this way. If you have been referred to us by a third party and that third party is entitled to a commission payment based on transaction volumes, numbers or types of transactions, we may share personal data, including transactional information, with that third party in order to reconcile commission payments. Where personal data is collected by or through a third party such as a merchant, promotion website or Offshore Money® partner website, the collection and use of your personal data may also be governed by the privacy policy of the third party.</p>
            <p>Control of Personal Information</p>
            <p>If your personal details (such as your name, address, or telephone number ) change you must immediately update your details in the &quot;Profile&quot; section of your Offshore Money® Account or by contacting Customer Service.
